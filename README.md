# Sparspak.jl

Translation of the well-known sparse matrix software Sparspak (Waterloo Sparse Matrix Package), solving
large sparse systems of linear algebraic equations. Sparspak is composed of the
subroutines from the book "Computer Solution of Large Sparse Positive Definite
Systems" by Alan George and Joseph Liu. Originally written in Fortran 77, later
rewritten in Fortran 90. Here is the software translated into Julia.
